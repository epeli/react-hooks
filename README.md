# âš“ @epeli/redux-hooks

React Hooks implementation for Redux that does not suffer from the tearing /
"zombie child component" problems. [Read more](#-why-yet-another-redux-hooks-implementation).

It also implements performance optimizations eg. does not render when the map
state function does not produce new value and allows advanced
optimizations with memoizing and dependency arrays.

Written in TypeScript so types are baked in and always up to date.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

    npm install @epeli/redux-hooks

## ðŸ“– Usage

```ts
import {useMapState, useActionCreators} from "@epeli/redux-hooks";

const ActionCreators = {
    inc() {
        return {type: "INCREMENT"};
    },
};

function Counter() {
    const count = useMapState(state => state.count);
    const actions = useActionCreators(ActionCreators);

    return <button onClick={actions.inc}>{count}</button>;
}
```

Your components must be wrapped with the `HooksProvider`

```ts
import {HooksProvider} from "@epeli/redux-hooks";

ReactDOM.render(
    <HooksProvider store={store}>
        <Counter />
    </HooksProvider>,
    document.getElementById("app"),
);
```

Custom provider is required for now because the official react-redux bindings
do not use subscriptions and it's impossible to implement Redux hooks without
efficiently. Read more about it
[here](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1177).

## ðŸ“š Available hooks

-   `useMapState()` Renders when returned value differ using [`Object.is()`][is] check
-   `useSelect()` Renders when returned value differ using shallow equal check
-   `useActionCreators()` Bind object of action creators to dispatch
-   `useDispatch()` Returns the plain dispatch-function
-   `usePassiveMapState()` Like `useMapState()` but does not subscribe to the
    store eg. is executed only when the component renders.

Please read the [optimizations docs](docs/optimizing.md) for details when to use these.

## TypeScript usage

You can use `createHooks()` factory to create custom typed version of the hooks

```ts
import {createHooks} from "@epeli/redux-hooks";

const AppHooks = createHooks<{foo: string}>();

function Foo() {
    const foo = AppHooks.useMapState(state => state.foo);
    return <div>String: {foo}</div>;
}
```

## ðŸ¤” Why yet another Redux Hooks implementation?

All the others I checked had the zombie child bug, poor performance or were missing TypeScript types.

Even the `facebookincubator/redux-react-hook` one has the zombie bug which is stated in their [FAQ](https://github.com/facebookincubator/redux-react-hook/blob/da74ab765c200133f86b629869ba1fdbf46afa97/README.md#how-does-this-compare-to-react-redux). This one guarantees data flow top down like the official react-redux one does.

This also an experiment for the future of the react-redux:
