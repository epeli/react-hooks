# âš“ @epeli/redux-hooks

React Hooks implementation for Redux that does not suffer from the tearing /
"zombie child component" problems.

It also implements performance optimizations eg. does not render when the map
state function does not produce new value and allows advanced
optimizations with memoizing and dependency arrays.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

    npm install @epeli/redux-hooks

## ðŸ“– Usage

```ts
import {useMapState, useActionCreators} from "@epeli/redux-hooks";

const ActionCreators = {
    inc() {
        return {type: "INCREMENT"};
    },
};

function Counter() {
    const count = useMapState(state => state.count);
    const actions = useActionCreators(ActionCreators);

    return <button onClick={actions.inc}>{count}</button>;
}
```

Your components must be wrapped with the `HooksProvider`

```ts
import {HooksProvider} from "@epeli/redux-hooks";

ReactDOM.render(
    <HooksProvider store={store}>
        <Counter />
    </HooksProvider>,
    document.getElementById("app"),
);
```

Custom provider is required for now because the official react-redux bindings
do not use subscriptions and it's impossible to implement Redux hooks without
efficiently. Read more about it
[here](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1177).

## ðŸš€ Optimizing rendering

The abobe API is enough for most use cases but if you want to get everything out off
your hooks please read the [optimizations docs](docs/optimizing.md).

## ðŸ¤” Why Yet Another Redux Hooks implementation?

All the others I checked had the zombie child bug.

This also an experiment for the future of the react-redux:
